    "section": "1.2 Standards and principles relating to RDM",
    "text": "1.2 Standards and principles relating to RDM\nAt this point, the cornerstones for a successful RDM are defined. A reference can be made to the rules of good scientific practice and/or to the peculiarities of the subject cultures.\n\n1.2.1 According to which standards should the RDM be carried out?\nResearch Data Management should be carried out according to the principles of good scientific practice, as well as any specific guidelines or regulations that may be relevant to the subject area or institution involved. This may include standards for data collection, organization, preservation, and sharing, as well as ethical considerations related to the use of research data. Additionally, it may be important to consider the unique requirements and challenges of the subject area, such as the large volumes of data generated by radio astronomy, and develop appropriate strategies for managing and analyzing this data.\n\n\n1.2.2 Should reference be made to the rules of good scientific practice?\nYes, it is advisable to reference the rules of good scientific practice when defining the cornerstones for successful research data management. The principles of good scientific practice provide a set of guidelines that help to ensure the integrity, transparency, and reproducibility of scientific research. These principles include principles such as honesty, objectivity, fairness, transparency, and accountability, which are essential for promoting trust in scientific research and ensuring that research is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner. By referencing the rules of good scientific practice, the proposed initiative can demonstrate its commitment to upholding these principles and ensuring that research data is managed in a way that is consistent with these principles. This can help to build trust and confidence in the research being conducted, and can help to promote the long-term success and sustainability of the initiative.\n\n\n1.2.3 Are there institutional recommendations for good scientific practice?\nThere are institutional recommendations for good scientific practice in the context of this initiative. Good scientific practice refers to a set of principles and guidelines that researchers should follow in order to conduct high-quality, ethical research. These guidelines can vary depending on the institution and field of research, but generally include principles such as honesty, transparency, and reproducibility. It is not specified in the text whether the participating institutions have specific recommendations for good scientific practice, or whether they will be following a specific set of guidelines in their research data management.\n\n\n1.2.4 What is the relationship between RDM and good scientific practice?\nThe relationship between research data management and good scientific practice is that good scientific practice involves conducting research in a transparent and reproducible manner, and part of achieving this transparency and reproducibility involves effective management of research data. This includes things like keeping detailed and accurate records of data collection and analysis, maintaining the integrity and security of the data, and making the data available for verification and reuse by others. By following these principles, researchers can ensure that their work is conducted in a reliable and trustworthy manner, and that their findings can be independently verified and built upon by other researchers.\n\n\n1.2.5 Should the special features of the subject cultures be addressed?\nIt is generally a good idea to take into account the special features of subject cultures when defining the cornerstones for successful research data management. This can help ensure that the research data management practices are tailored to the specific needs and requirements of the research field, and can lead to more effective and efficient management of research data. Additionally, addressing the peculiarities of the subject cultures can help to ensure that the research data management practices are in line with the norms and standards of the research community, which can improve the credibility and trustworthiness of the research findings.\n\n\n1.2.6 Should reference be made to definitions, e.g. in the appendix of the FD policy?\nIt is generally a good idea to consult the relevant guidelines and policies when developing a research data management plan in order to ensure compliance and best practices.\n\n\n1.2.7 Should central terms such as research data and RDM be defined in the text?\nIt is recommended to define central terms such as research data and research data management in the text. This can help ensure that all readers have a clear understanding of the concepts being discussed, and can help avoid confusion or misunderstandings. Additionally, providing definitions can help to establish the context and relevance of these terms within the proposal, and can help to support the overall goals and objectives of the initiative."

    "text": "A target group definition ensures that the addressees are clearly named and feel ad- dressed. As a rule, the target group includes all persons working at the institution (re- searchers, visiting scientists, students, and employees).\nIn addition, it can also be specified at this point what kind of research data the FD policy should cover, e.g. non-digital research data can be excluded or restrictions can be formulated, such as the restriction exclusively to research data from projects of one’s own institution.\nThe definition of range thus has an influence on the cost of RDM.\n\n\nThe proposal describes a plan to create a cluster for interdisciplinary research and teaching in the fields of radio astronomy and data science in the North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) region of Germany. The cluster, called the “B3D Cluster” (short for “Big Bang to Big Data”), will combine the expertise of several universities and research institutions, and will focus on developing technologies for managing and analyzing large amounts of data generated by radio astronomical research. The proposal also mentions using artificial intelligence (AI) for astronomical data analysis, and developing new qualification programs for young scientists in NRW. The long-term goal is to establish NRW as a nucleus of excellence for machine learning and AI, and to involve partners from industry in the project. The proposal is seeking funds to support the establishment of the cluster.\n\n\n\nThe target group for the B3D Cluster includes all persons working at participating institutions, including researchers, visiting scientists, students, and employees. The proposal also mentions the potential for involving partners from industry in the project. The scope of the cluster’s research data policy will be determined by the participating institutions, and may include restrictions on the type of data covered or the source of the data.

    "text": "2.2 Relationship to legal requirements/contracts with third parties\nThe RDM must comply with all legal and internal regulations as well as Contracts with donors. A regulation on which requirements take precedence creates clarity for researchers.\n\n2.2.1 What is the relationship to legal provisions and requirements of the institution?\nThe Research Data Management must comply with all legal and internal regulations as well as Contracts with donors. This means that the institution must ensure that the research data is collected, stored, and managed in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, as well as any agreements or contracts with donors or funding agencies. This may include requirements related to data privacy, data security, data sharing, and data preservation. The institution may also have its own internal policies and guidelines for research data management, which must be followed by researchers and other staff members. These policies may include requirements for data documentation, data organization, data access, and data reuse.\nIn addition, the institution may have specific requirements for research data management depending on the type of research being conducted and the funding sources involved. For example, some funding agencies may have specific requirements for data sharing and accessibility, or for the use of certain data management tools and platforms. Researchers must ensure that they are aware of and comply with these requirements in order to avoid any potential problems or delays in their research.\n\n\n2.2.2 Which contracts have priority, especially in third-party funded research? and Do the contracts of third-party funding providers always take precedence or only if they contain stricter regulations, for example?\nThe priority of contracts in third-party-funded research is determined by the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties involved. If the contracts of third-party funding providers contain stricter regulations than the institution’s internal regulations, then those regulations would take precedence. It is important to carefully review the terms and conditions of all contracts involved in order to determine which regulations have priority and ensure compliance with all legal and internal regulations.\n\n\n2.2.3 What should be considered in the case of research collaborations?\nIn the case of research collaborations, it is important to ensure that all parties involved in the collaboration are aware of and agree to the terms and conditions for managing and sharing research data. This can include the types of data that will be collected and shared, who will have access to the data, and how the data will be stored and managed. It may also be necessary to consider any legal or ethical implications of the research, such as the need to obtain consent from individuals whose data is being used. Additionally, it may be necessary to clarify any intellectual property rights and ownership of the data. By carefully considering these issues and establishing clear agreements between all parties involved in the collaboration, researchers can ensure that the data is managed and shared in a responsible and transparent manner.\n\n\n2.2.4 What is valid if projects have their own RD policy?\nIf projects have their own research data policies, those policies should be followed in regards to the management of research data. The specific requirements and regulations of the project’s research data policy should take precedence over any institutional or general policies. It is important to clearly define and communicate the research data policy for each project in order to ensure compliance and provide clarity for researchers."

In this context, it is important to stress the importance of the role of social partners in the development of the labor market. In principle, the regulations governing the ownership of rights must be clarified with the responsible department or legal department and the regulations for researchers without an employment contract must also be named. In doing so, legal regulations, in particular the freedom of science guaranteed in the Basic Law (Art. 5 para. 3), must be observed.\n\n\nIt is important to clarify the ownership of rights in research collaborations, as it can affect the ability of researchers to access and use the data generated by their research. In general, the ownership of rights is determined by the employment contract or specific association of the researchers involved in the collaboration. It may be necessary to consult with the responsible department or legal department to ensure that the regulations governing the ownership of rights are properly understood and followed. In addition, the regulations for researchers without an employment contract should also be considered. Legal regulations, such as the freedom of science guaranteed in the Basic Law, must also be taken into account when determining the ownership of rights in research collaborations.\n\n\n\nThe ownership of rights is determined by the employment contract or specific association. In general, the regulations governing the ownership of rights should be clarified with the responsible department or legal department, and the regulations for researchers without an employment contract should also be identified. Legal regulations, including the freedom of science guaranteed in the Basic Law (Article 5, paragraph 3), should be taken into account. The specific details of the ownership of rights in a research collaboration will depend on the individual circumstances of the collaboration and the agreements made between the involved parties. It is important to clarify and agree on these details before the collaboration begins.\n\n\n\nThe ownership of rights to research data is determined by the employment contract or specific association of the researchers involved in the project. It is important to clarify the ownership of rights with the responsible department or legal department and to ensure that the regulations for researchers without an employment contract are also addressed. Legal regulations, particularly the freedom of science guaranteed in the Basic Law (Art. 5 para. 3), must be observed in all cases.\n\n\n\nAuthorship, patent rights, trademark law, and personal rights are typically regulated in the employment contracts or agreements between the researchers and their respective institutions. These contracts or agreements will outline the ownership and rights of use for any intellectual property created or developed by the researchers during the course of their work. In the case of funding contracts, the ownership and rights of use may be outlined in the agreement between the funding party and the researcher or institution. It is important for all parties involved to carefully review and understand the terms of these agreements in order to ensure that ownership and rights of use are properly defined and protected.\n\n\n\nThe ownership of non-protectable data may be regulated by the employment contracts or agreements between the researchers and the university, or by other agreements (funding contracts). It is important to clarify the ownership of non-protectable data with the responsible department or legal department in order to ensure that all parties involved are aware of their rights and obligations.\n\n\n\nOwnership of data and its usage rights are regulated by employment contracts and other agreements between researchers and their institutions, but it is not clear if personally marking data is part of those agreements. It is also not specified if data is to be marked for personal identification purposes or for other reasons."

    "text": "In the definitions in the Annex/Glossary, terms from the text of the FD This is the first time that we have had a debate on this subject in the Committee on Budgets. On the one hand, the definitions can take into account the specific framework conditions, the result of the assessment of the situation in the preliminary considerations and the resulting action in the RDM. On the other hand, the definitions can also serve as a general explanation of terms in connection with research data and RDM (such as repository, metadata, persistent identifier, etc.). - Which definition of research data fits the institution’s self-image?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch data include, among other things, measurement data, laboratory values, audiovisual information, texts, survey data, objects from collections or samples that are created, developed or evaluated in scientific work. Methodological test procedures such as questionnaires, software and simulations can also represent central results of scientific research and should therefore also be included under the term research data.\nResearch data are digital data generated by scientific source research, experiments, measurements, simulations, surveys or surveys. They include structured mass data as well as unstructured data of various formats and contents, including process data such as processing steps, algorithms and programs developed in a research project or digitized fonts, images or films.\n\n\n\n\nResearch data management encompasses all measures – beyond research action in the narrower sense also organization-related – that must be taken in order to obtain high-quality data, to comply with good scientific practice in the data life cycle, to make results reproducible and data available for reuse, and to meet any existing documentation obligations […]\n\n\n\nResearch is the search for new insights – as opposed to accidental discovery – as well as their systematic documentation and publication.\n\n\n\nResearchers are all members of the [name of institution] […], in particular employees and doctoral candidates. The term also includes persons who are not directly associated with [name of institution] […] but who use the infrastructure of [name of institution] […] for research purposes. Guest researchers or cooperation partners are also expected to comply with the policy.\n\n\n\nFunding organisations are increasingly requiring project participants to draw up a data management plan and scientific institutions to adapt to the requirements of sustainable data management. Data management plans at the beginning of a project or research work are suitable for describing the data to be used and generated and the necessary documentation, metadata and standards, for identifying possible legal restrictions (e.g. data protection) in good time, for planning required storage resources and for determining criteria for which data is to be made available to external parties in what form and how long the data is to be secured. At the organizational level, research institutions (e.g. universities) must ensure access to appropriate infrastructure services within the institution (e.g. by building up and expanding suitable capacities) or in cooperation with external partners (through cooperation agreements, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nA repository is a database or data archive for the storage and publication of digital research data with the primary purpose of keeping it available and citable and reusable for an unlimited period of time. Through appropriate rights and license management, different levels of access to the research data (e.g. project-internal, cross-project and public) can be regulated and their access and usage conditions can be defined. 33\nA digital repository is a mechanism for managing and storing digital content. Repositories can be subject or institutional in their focus. Putting content into an institutional repository enables staff and institutions to manage and preserve it, and therefore derive maximum value from it. […] Repositories use open standards to ensure that the content they contain is accessible in that it can be searched and retrieved for later use. The use of these agreed international standards allows mechanisms to be set up which import, export, identify, store and retrieve the digital content within the repository. Digital repositories may include a wide range of content for a variety of purposes and users. […] Typically content can include research outputs such as journal articles or research data, e-theses, e-learning objects and teaching materials, and administrative data.34\n\n\n\n\nMetadata refers to all additional information that is necessary or useful for the interpretation of the actual data, e.g. research data, and that enables (automatic) processing of the research data by technical systems. Metadata is therefore often referred to as ’data about data’ and serves to categorize and characterize the different information about digital objects: Technical metadata contains, for example, information on data volume and data format and is of central importance for sustainable data storage. Descriptive metadata (also known as descriptive or content metadata) provides information about the information contained in digital objects (e.g. scientific) and thus decides on its find- ability, referencing and reusability. In order for measurement data, for example, to be interpretable and reusable, the complete and correct indication of the […] Unity is essen- tial. Descriptive explanations (e.g. in the form of an abstract), which are kept together with the (research) data, are also useful. This also includes references to rights of use, equipment used, standards used if no corresponding publication is available.35\n\n\n\nPersistent identifiers are used for the clear and permanent addressing of digital re- sources. Unlike traditional web URLs, they distinguish between identification and address of a resource. With the help of a resoluting mechanism, it can be ensured that a resource can still be accessed even if its physical storage location has changed."
