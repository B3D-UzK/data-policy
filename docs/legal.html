<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ownership-of-rightsrights-of-use"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Ownership of rights/rights of use</h2>
<p>The ownership of rights is determined by the employment contract or specific association. In this context, it is important to stress the importance of the role of social partners in the development of the labor market. In principle, the regulations governing the ownership of rights must be clarified with the responsible department or legal department and the regulations for researchers without an employment contract must also be named. In doing so, legal regulations, in particular the freedom of science guaranteed in the Basic Law (Art. 5 para. 3), must be observed.</p>
<section id="how-is-the-ownership-of-rights-regulated" class="level3" data-number="3.1.1">
<h3 data-number="3.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-is-the-ownership-of-rights-regulated"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> How is the ownership of rights regulated?</h3>
<p>It is important to clarify the ownership of rights in research collaborations, as it can affect the ability of researchers to access and use the data generated by their research. In general, the ownership of rights is determined by the employment contract or specific association of the researchers involved in the collaboration. It may be necessary to consult with the responsible department or legal department to ensure that the regulations governing the ownership of rights are properly understood and followed. In addition, the regulations for researchers without an employment contract should also be considered. Legal regulations, such as the freedom of science guaranteed in the Basic Law, must also be taken into account when determining the ownership of rights in research collaborations.</p>
</section>
<section id="who-owns-which-rights-of-use-to-the-data" class="level3" data-number="3.1.2">
<h3 data-number="3.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-owns-which-rights-of-use-to-the-data"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Who owns which rights of use to the data?</h3>
<p>The ownership of rights is determined by the employment contract or specific association. In general, the regulations governing the ownership of rights should be clarified with the responsible department or legal department, and the regulations for researchers without an employment contract should also be identified. Legal regulations, including the freedom of science guaranteed in the Basic Law (Article 5, paragraph 3), should be taken into account. The specific details of the ownership of rights in a research collaboration will depend on the individual circumstances of the collaboration and the agreements made between the involved parties. It is important to clarify and agree on these details before the collaboration begins.</p>

<section id="which-rights-of-use-apply-to-funded-projects" class="level3" data-number="3.1.3">
<h3 data-number="3.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-rights-of-use-apply-to-funded-projects"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Which rights of use apply to funded projects?</h3>
<p>The ownership of rights to research data is determined by the employment contract or specific association of the researchers involved in the project. It is important to clarify the ownership of rights with the responsible department or legal department and to ensure that the regulations for researchers without an employment contract are also addressed. Legal regulations, particularly the freedom of science guaranteed in the Basic Law (Art. 5 para. 3), must be observed in all cases.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-are-authorship-patent-rights-trademark-law-personal-rights-regulated" class="level3" data-number="3.1.4">

<p>Authorship, patent rights, trademark law, and personal rights are typically regulated in the employment contracts or agreements between the researchers and their respective institutions. These contracts or agreements will outline the ownership and rights of use for any intellectual property created or developed by the researchers during the course of their work. In the case of funding contracts, the ownership and rights of use may be outlined in the agreement between the funding party and the researcher or institution. It is important for all parties involved to carefully review and understand the terms of these agreements in order to ensure that ownership and rights of use are properly defined and protected.</p>
</section>
<section id="who-owns-non-protectable-data" class="level3" data-number="3.1.5">
<h3 data-number="3.1.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-owns-non-protectable-data"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.5</span> Who owns non-protectable data?</h3>
<p>The ownership of non-protectable data may be regulated by the employment contracts or agreements between the researchers and the university, or by other agreements (funding contracts). It is important to clarify the ownership of non-protectable data with the responsible department or legal department in order to ensure that all parties involved are aware of their rights and obligations.</p>
</section>
<section id="is-data-to-be-personally-marked" class="level3" data-number="3.1.6">
<h3 data-number="3.1.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-data-to-be-personally-marked"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.6</span> Is data to be personally marked?</h3>
<p>Ownership of data and its usage rights are regulated by employment contracts and other agreements between researchers and their institutions, but it is not clear if personally marking data is part of those agreements. It is also not specified if data is to be marked for personal identification purposes or for other reasons.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-protection"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Data protection</h2>
<p>Especially in research with personal data, such as in the data protection aspects, can be explained in more detail in the fields of medicine, sociology, etc.</p>
<section id="how-is-compliance-with-legalethical-aspects-in-particular-data-protection-sensitive-data-personal-data-ensured" class="level3" data-number="3.2.1">

<p>Compliance with legal/ethical aspects, including data protection, is ensured by adhering to relevant laws and regulations, as well as by following established guidelines and protocols for handling sensitive and personal data. This may involve obtaining informed consent from individuals, anonymizing data, and implementing appropriate security measures to protect data from unauthorized access or use. Additionally, institutions involved in the research may have their own policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with legal/ethical requirements.</p>

<p>By regulating the transfer of rights, it can be ensured that data is freely available when rights are transferred to third parties, e.g.&nbsp;to publishers</p>

<p>In the case of a transfer of rights of re-use or publication, care should be taken to ensure that the data remain freely available for scientific purposes.</p>
<p>All rights to data, in particular the right to further use or publish the data, should be reserved for the Principal Investigators (PI) and should not be outsourced to third parties.</p>
