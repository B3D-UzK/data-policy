<p>A target group definition ensures that the addressees are clearly named and feel ad- dressed. As a rule, the target group includes all persons working at the institution (re- searchers, visiting scientists, students, and employees).</p>
<p>In addition, it can also be specified at this point what kind of research data the FD policy should cover, e.g.&nbsp;non-digital research data can be excluded or restrictions can be formulated, such as the restriction exclusively to research data from projects of one’s own institution.</p>
<p>The definition of range thus has an influence on the cost of RDM.</p>

<p>The proposal describes a plan to create a cluster for interdisciplinary research and teaching in the fields of radio astronomy and data science in the North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) region of Germany. The cluster, called the “B3D Cluster” (short for “Big Bang to Big Data”), will combine the expertise of several universities and research institutions, and will focus on developing technologies for managing and analyzing large amounts of data generated by radio astronomical research. The proposal also mentions using artificial intelligence (AI) for astronomical data analysis, and developing new qualification programs for young scientists in NRW. The long-term goal is to establish NRW as a nucleus of excellence for machine learning and AI, and to involve partners from industry in the project. The proposal is seeking funds to support the establishment of the cluster.</p>

<p>The target group for the B3D Cluster includes all persons working at participating institutions, including researchers, visiting scientists, students, and employees. The proposal also mentions the potential for involving partners from industry in the project. The scope of the cluster’s research data policy will be determined by the participating institutions, and may include restrictions on the type of data covered or the source of the data. The cost of implementing the data policy will also be influenced by the scope of the policy.</p>

<p>The RDM must comply with all legal and internal regulations as well as Contracts with donors. A regulation on which requirements take precedence creates clarity for researchers.</p>

<p>The Research Data Management must comply with all legal and internal regulations as well as Contracts with donors. This means that the institution must ensure that the research data is collected, stored, and managed in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, as well as any agreements or contracts with donors or funding agencies. This may include requirements related to data privacy, data security, data sharing, and data preservation. The institution may also have its own internal policies and guidelines for research data management, which must be followed by researchers and other staff members. These policies may include requirements for data documentation, data organization, data access, and data reuse.</p>
<p>In addition, the institution may have specific requirements for research data management depending on the type of research being conducted and the funding sources involved. For example, some funding agencies may have specific requirements for data sharing and accessibility, or for the use of certain data management tools and platforms. Researchers must ensure that they are aware of and comply with these requirements in order to avoid any potential problems or delays in their research.</p>

<p>The priority of contracts in third-party-funded research is determined by the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties involved. If the contracts of third-party funding providers contain stricter regulations than the institution’s internal regulations, then those regulations would take precedence. It is important to carefully review the terms and conditions of all contracts involved in order to determine which regulations have priority and ensure compliance with all legal and internal regulations.</p>

<p>In the case of research collaborations, it is important to ensure that all parties involved in the collaboration are aware of and agree to the terms and conditions for managing and sharing research data. This can include the types of data that will be collected and shared, who will have access to the data, and how the data will be stored and managed. It may also be necessary to consider any legal or ethical implications of the research, such as the need to obtain consent from individuals whose data is being used. Additionally, it may be necessary to clarify any intellectual property rights and ownership of the data. By carefully considering these issues and establishing clear agreements between all parties involved in the collaboration, researchers can ensure that the data is managed and shared in a responsible and transparent manner.</p>

<p>If projects have their own research data policies, those policies should be followed in regards to the management of research data. The specific requirements and regulations of the project’s research data policy should take precedence over any institutional or general policies. It is important to clearly define and communicate the research data policy for each project in order to ensure compliance and provide clarity for researchers.</p>
